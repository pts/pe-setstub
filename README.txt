pe-setstub: replace DOS stub in Win32 PE .exe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
pe-setstub contains Perl script setstub.pl to replace the DOS stub in a
Win32 PE .exe file. It works with DOS stubs of any size (even larger than
200 KiB), and the output .exe remains compatibile with all versions of
Windows (Windows NT 3.1 ... Windows 10) and Wine and Win32s as well.

Limitation: If the code uses the header mapped at ImageBase, then the output
.exe will not work, because setstub.pl moves the PE header and also
truncates it at the end of the section headers. PE .exe files generated by
most C and C++ compilers (e.g. OpenWatcom V2, MinGW GCC, TCC) just work
fine.
